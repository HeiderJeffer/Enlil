# Monte Carlo Simulation Python and calculate complexit metrics of the code
- by Heider Jeffer
## In This project we answer the following question
- what is the longest random walk you can take so that on average you will end up 4 blocks or fewer from home?
- The Longest-Random-Walk
##  We used multimetric to calculate the following metrics for this project:
* Comment to Code percentage
* Cyclomatic complexity according to McCabe
* Difficulty according to Halstead
* Effort according to Halstead
* Fan-Out
* Lines of code
* Maintainability index
* Metric according to pylint
* Metric according to TIOBE
* Number of delivered bugs according to Halstead
* Time required to program according to Halstead
* Volume according to Halstead
